## 1 ENCY APP Introduction: 

Ency App is an application to help sales agents quickly create business proposals.

It is integrated with Zoho Books, so that the proposal generated by the app is also created in Books as a "Draft Proposal".

App accesses the complete customer record (more than 3,000) with their full name and organization number.

It allows the manipulation of plans provided by the client and generate a new plan where you can see the products that are going to be installed in the corresponding scale.

It allows adding customer information, their needs, problems, information about the building and calculation of energy savings.
 
It is possible to view and then save in PDF and generate a backup on the Ipad.

The final result is a proposal in PDF format that can be shared by email or printed according to the app selected.

## 2. Data integration, read and storage:

### 2.1 Integration:

The integration to Zoho Books is done in 2 steps:

- In the first step, the App sends the proposal information to Zapier via hooks through a POST call.
- In the second step Zapier connects with Zoho and creates the proposal in Books, creating a new proposal in the draft.

### 2.2 Read Data

The application reads data from JSON format files (these are part of the application), to show the complete list of customers and the list of products.

### 2.3 Record data

The application records backup data for each proposal created, using Core Data,
These data are recorded on the iPad.

### 2.4 Sharing data

The application shares data of the proposal created in PDF file, using a module that allows you to send this file to other applications available in the app, for example: gmail, Print, Notes.

### 2.5 Read data from Google Sheets:

To read data in Google Sheets , the app makes a GET API call to the servicehttps://sheetson.com and this is connected to the Google Sheets spreadsheet with the information of the new users.
